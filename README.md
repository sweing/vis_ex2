# InfoVis UE - Exercise 2: Linked View with d3

Scaffold for building multiple coordinated views using d3 with a Python backend using Flask.

## Project setup using PyCharm:


1. Create new PyCharm project from this folder
2. Creating Virtual Environment:
Ctrl+Alt+S to open Settings
--> Project
--> Project Interpreter
--> select the gear symbol next to "Project Interpreter"
--> Add...
--> "Virtualenv Environment
--> New environment
--> OK
3. Install required packages:
open requirements.txt
--> click on "Install requirements" from bar on the top
Alternatively, you can install the requirements individually from the Project Interpreter menu (select "+")
4. Set Working Directory:
in order to load data on the server, you might need to set your Working Directory on PyCharm, otherwise you might get
the error "No such file or directory" when attemping to load data.
To do that, open Run
--> Edit Configurations...
set your Working Directory to the root directory (i.e. where "app.py" and the "static" folder are located)


## Files:

* app.py: Flask server
* templates/index.html: our single HTML page, including the main JavaScript code
* static/js/: folder where your JavaScript files should go
* static/js/map.js: JavaScript / d3 code for map rendering 
* static/data/: folder where your data should go
* static/data/world-topo.json: the world map as topojson
* static/styles/style.css: CSS styles

You may modify all files, except for the data files. You may (and actually should) add JavaScript files to static/js.
